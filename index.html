Open Terminal
Use the cd command to change directories into your repo folder
Turn this folder into a git repo
Use the following command:
git init
You should see the message “Initialized empty Git repository”
Then use git add
git add README.md
You can run git status to see added files
Next you need to commit changes
Commit early and commit often.
git commit -am "first commit"
Now we need to change to the main branch:
git branch -M main
We need to add the remote repo as the “origin” of this branch.
Copy this line from GitHub: git remote add origin https://github.com/shermandy/test-repo.git
Make sure you get the correct version directly from GitHub.
Now you need to push your changes to GitHub. 
git push origin main
If there are no errors, load the repo in your browser and see if you see your code appears.
